# Open-Source AI-Based Dubbing Tools for Multilingual Video Translation and Voice-Over

## Overview

This project aims to overcome language barriers in multimedia localization by providing **open-source AI-based dubbing tools**. The platform combines cutting-edge machine learning models to deliver high-quality, context-aware, and culturally sensitive solutions for multilingual video translation and voice-over. By democratizing access to video localization tools, this project fosters diversity, intercultural understanding, and effective global communication.

## Features

- **Multilingual Transcription**: Automatic video transcription using CNN and LSTM models.
- **Multilingual Translation**: Context-aware translations using advanced transformer models.
- **Dubbing and Voice Synthesis**: AI-powered dubbing that respects linguistic and cultural nuances.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Feedback loops to improve system quality continuously.
- **Intuitive Interface**: A simple upload, translate, and download workflow for seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API**: Converts text into natural-sounding speech.
- **Google Cloud Translate API**: Provides reliable multilingual text translations.
- **Whisper ASR**: Handles audio transcription from video files.
- **Spacy**: Used for natural language processing tasks like tokenization.
- **PyDub**: Processes audio files for dubbing.
- **MoviePy**: Edits and synchronizes audio and video.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
1. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install google-cloud-texttospeech google-cloud-translate spacy pydub moviepy
   ```
2. Set up Google Cloud APIs and credentials for Text-to-Speech and Translate.

### Workflow
1. **Upload Video**: Input your video file to the system.
2. **Choose Language**: Select the desired target language for translation and dubbing.
3. **Download Translated Video**: Retrieve the output video with the translated and synchronized audio.

### Supported Languages
- English (`en-US`)
- Spanish (`es-US`)
- German (`de-DE`)
- Italian (`it-IT`)
- French (`fr-FR`)
- Russian (`ru-RU`)
- Hindi (`hi-IN`)
